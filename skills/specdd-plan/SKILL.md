# SpecDD Plan

Use this skill when the user asks for a plan, or when unclear scope, authority,
public contracts, risk, or verification would make immediate implementation
unsafe. Do not edit files while planning.

## Bootstrap Resolution

Before doing anything else in the target project, read bootstrap files in this exact order:

1. `.specdd/bootstrap.md`
2. `.specdd/bootstrap.project.md`, if it exists
3. `.specdd/bootstrap.local.md`, if it exists

Apply them in that order. Later files may narrow or specialize earlier rules, but must not silently weaken project contracts, inherited constraints, or write authority.

## Spec Chain Resolution

Before planning, editing, reviewing, testing, or reporting on a target:

1. Identify the target path, task, behavior, or changed files.
2. Resolve the effective spec chain using the active bootstrap rules.
3. Include same-directory basename specs when applicable.
4. Walk ancestor specs from the selected content root to the target.
5. Read explicit `References` only when they affect the requested work.
6. Identify the nearest local spec that grants write authority before any edit.

Do not infer authority from similar filenames, nearby files, symbols, module names, or conventions unless the active bootstrap or a governing spec explicitly defines that mapping.

## Workflow

1. Summarize the target scope and applicable spec chain.
2. Identify files or specs likely to change.
3. Identify verification and blockers.
4. Summarize the smallest safe implementation path.

## Plan Contents

Include:

- Target scope and applicable spec chain.
- Files or specs likely to change.
- Write authority and any unclear authority.
- Relevant `Must`, `Must not`, `Forbids`, `Scenario`, `Tasks`, and `Done when` constraints.
- Verification likely needed.
- Risks, conflicts, or questions that block safe implementation.

Keep the plan practical. Do not propose broad refactors or new contracts unless
the active specs or user request require them.
